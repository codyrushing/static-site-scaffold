# Static site generator with Assemble.io, Sass, Babel, and Gulp

My static site generator that features:
* Handlebars for templates and markdown for content (powered by [Assemble.io](https://github.com/assemble/assemble))
* Sass with basic responsive breakpoints, with [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) built-in
* JS app bundling with Babel ES2015 transpiling and Babelify for modules
* Gulp for building all front end assets

* `npm run build` - Builds all front end assets
* `npm run dev` - Builds all front end assets in dev mode and watches source files
